- pointer guard is actually stored in the thread control block. (TCB)

mangling: 
	- it will XOR with the pointer guard in the thread control block. and the it will shift left by 0x11.

demangling:
	- This will shift right 0x11 and then XOR to the pointer guard.

attack:
	- make the pointer guard to 0 
	- change the exit function to system and argument as the pointer to the string "/bin/sh\x00".
