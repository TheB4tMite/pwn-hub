Any pwner should be able to reverse a challenge, so git gud in reversing.

## Topic here:
| topics | description | why |
| --- | --- | --- |
|[CMU bomb labs](./cmu-bomblab/cmubomb)| fun assembly reversing levels with varying difficulty | get a better understanding of how assembly works |
|[Crackmees](./crackme/)| Some general crackmees to get you started with pwn | understanding how a function works through assembly code review |
|[mapleCTF - lost-in-space](./assembly-challs/fun-assembly-challenge/) | Creating a search algorithm in x86 assembly to find the correct | Get better at writing assembly code |
|[elf crafting - v2](./elf-internals/) | Understanding the elf structure to build a tiny ELF | Understanding the internals of what you exploit is good |
